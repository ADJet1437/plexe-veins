This repo is forked from https://github.com/michele-segata/plexe-veins, it is only used for my master thesis work.

I particularly investigated on MAC layer beaconing methods based on the plexe-2.0 version from https://github.com/michele-segata/plexe-veins, the new beaconing protoclos are called:
DccBeaconing, DccBeaconing_new, DrDccBeaconing, and TxDccBeaconing respectively in the protocols directory.
